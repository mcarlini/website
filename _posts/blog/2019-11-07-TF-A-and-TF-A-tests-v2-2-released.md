Trusted Firmware-A and the related Trusted Firmware-A tests v2.2 have now been released! The TF-A change logs and TF-A-Test change logs show the updates, but we've shown some of the highlights below:  


Important highlights of the TF-A log include: 
* Armv8.3 Pointer Authentication use in Secure world (EL3 and lower S-ELs)
* Adds support for ARMv8.3-Pointer Authentication in BL1 SMC calls and BL2U image for firmware updates.
* Armv8.5 Branch Target Identification
* Armv8.5 Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) enabled for the Normal world and Secure world 
* MTE support is now enabled by default on systems that support it at EL0.
* GICv3 Driver updates for multi socket GIC redistributor discovery 
* RSA - 3072 support as per latest version of TBSA/TBFU
* Speculative Store Bypass Safe (SSBS): Further enhance protection against Spectre variant 4 by disabling speculative loads/stores (SPSR.SSBS bit) by default.


Additionally, Arm CPU support now includes the following features:
* Support introduced for new cores: Hercules, HerculesAE, Cortex- A76AE, Cortex- A65, A65AE
* Various errata workarounds for the cores: N1, Cortex-A76, A55, A35, A9 and for the DSU
* New/enhanced features:
  * Neoverse N1: force cacheable atomic to near atomic and workaround for various errata. 
  * Zeus: apply MSR SSBS instruction


Many new partner platform ports have been added to our current lineup. This includes support for: 
* Amlogic S905X2 (G12A) and S905x (GXL) platform
* Arm A5 DesignStart and Arm Corestone-700
* Intel Agilex
* MediaTek mt8183
* QEMU SBSA platform
* Renesas R-Car Gen3: New platform support added for D3
* Rockchip px30 and rk3288
* Raspberry Pi 4


The highlights for the TF-A-Tests include:
* Secure partition quark


* New tests:
  * Basic unit tests for xlat table library v2.
  * Tests for validating SVE support in TF-A.
  * Stress tests for dynamic xlat table library.
  * PSCI test to measure latencies when turning ON a cluster. 
  * Series of AArch64 tests that stress the secure world to leak sensitive counter values.
  * Test to validate PSCI SYSTEM_RESET call.
  * Basic tests to validate Memory Tagging Extensions are being enabled and ensuring no undesired leak of sensitive data occurs.


* Enhanced tests:
  * Improved tests for Pointer Authentication support. Checks are performed to see if pointer authentication keys are accessible as well as validate if secure keys are being leaked after a PSCI version call or TSP call.
  * Improved AMU test to remove unexecuted code iterating over Group1 counters and fix the conditional check of AMU Group0 counter value.
