## TF-A Technical Forum

This is an open forum conference call for anyone to participate and it is not restricted to TF members. It will operate under the guidance of the TF TSC. Invites and other traffic are via the TF-M mailing list. Attendees are welcome to propose agenda items.

Due to expected attendees from Asia, Europe and the Americas, the timeslot is challenging. We hope it's not too difficult for anyone - we continue to review the scheduling.

### The first call is planned on Thursday, March 12th at 17:00 UTC


To receive an invite, please join the TF-A mailing list. [Subscribe to the TF-A list](https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/mailman/listinfo/tf-a), or see the links at the bottom of the page.
