## TF-M Technical Forum

As mentioned in the TF-M workshop in Lyon at the start of November 19, we have kicked off the TF-M Technical Forum calls, starting on the 5th December 2019. This is an open forum for anyone to participate and it is not restricted to TF members. It will operate under the guidance of the TF TSC.

Due to expected attendees from Asia, Europe and the Americas, the timeslot is challenging. We hope it's not too difficult for anyone - we can review after the first couple of meetings.

Initially we propose a bi-weekly call and then we'll change cadence depending on interest

The calendar invite is below and contains the conference coordinates. Feel free to also forward it to your colleagues.
